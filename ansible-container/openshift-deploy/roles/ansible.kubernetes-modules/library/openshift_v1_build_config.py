    - script is a shell script to be run with `/bin/sh -ic`. It may not be specified
      with Command. Use Script when a shell script is appropriate to execute the post
      build hook, for example for running unit tests with `rake test`. If you need
      control over the image entrypoint, or if the image does not have `/bin/sh`,
      use Command and/or Args. The `-i` flag is needed to support CentOS and RHEL
      images that use Software Collections (SCL), in order to have the appropriate
      collections enabled in the shell. E.g., in the Ruby image, this is necessary
      to make `ruby`, `bundle` and other binaries available in the PATH.

  spec_source_binary_as_file:
    description:
    - asFile indicates that the provided binary input should be considered a single
      file within the build input. For example, specifying "webapp.war" would place
      the provided binary as `/webapp.war` for the builder. If left empty, the Docker
      and Source build strategies assume this file is a zip, tar, or tar.gz file and

            may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be
            shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example,
            a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will
            react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the
            pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal
            (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the

              - binary builds accept a binary as their input. The binary is generally
                assumed to be a tar, gzipped tar, or zip file depending on the strategy.
                For Docker builds, this is the build context and an optional Dockerfile
                may be specified to override any Dockerfile in the build context.
                For Source builds, this is assumed to be an archive as described above.
                For Source and Docker builds, if binary.asFile is set the build will
                receive a directory with a single file. contextDir may be used when
                an archive is provided. Custom builds will receive this binary as
                input on STDIN.

                    for the builder. If left empty, the Docker and Source build strategies
                    assume this file is a zip, tar, or tar.gz file and extract it
