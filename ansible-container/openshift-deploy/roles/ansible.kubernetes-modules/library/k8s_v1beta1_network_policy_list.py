      C(present), the object will be created, if it does not exist, or patched, if
      parameter values differ from the existing object's attributes, and deleted,
      if set to C(absent). A patch operation results in merging lists and updating
      dictionaries, with lists being merged into a unique set of values. If a list
      contains a dictionary with a I(name) or I(type) attribute, a strategic merge
      is performed, where individual elements with a matching I(name_) or I(type)
      are merged. To force the replacement of lists, set the I(force) option to C(True).

                will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion
                is requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client.
                The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource
                lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field. Once
                set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future,
                although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior
                to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted
                in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination
                signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet
                will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and
                after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network
                partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until
                an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is
                fully terminated. If not set, graceful deletion of the object has
                not been requested. Populated by the system when a graceful deletion

                and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make
                the value unique on the server. If this field is specified and the
