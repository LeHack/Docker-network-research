                  - DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource
                    will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful
                    deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable
                    by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer
                    visible from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after
                    the time in this field. Once set, this value may not be unset
                    or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened
                    or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example,
                    a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet
                    will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers
                    in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard
                    termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup,
                    remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions,
                    this object may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator
                    or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated.
