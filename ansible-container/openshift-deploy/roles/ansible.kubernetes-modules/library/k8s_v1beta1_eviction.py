          type: int
        deletion_timestamp:
          description:
          - DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will
            be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is
            requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource
            is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and
            not reachable by name) after the time in this field. Once set, this value
            may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be
            shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example,
            a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will
            react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the
            pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal
            (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the
            API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still exist
            after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can
            determine the resource is fully terminated. If not set, graceful deletion
            of the object has not been requested. Populated by the system when a graceful
            deletion is requested. Read-only.

            is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry
            from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries
            in this list can only be removed.

        generate_name:
          description:
          - GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a
            unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field
            is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name
            passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided
            value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated
            by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.
            If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will
            NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with
            Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the
            time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time
            indicated in the Retry-After header). Applied only if Name is not specified.
