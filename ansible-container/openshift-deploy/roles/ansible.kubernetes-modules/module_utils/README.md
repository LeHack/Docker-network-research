### module_utils

If you're running Ansible 2.3, custom module_utils is supported. 

The K8s and OpenShift common modules will land in Ansible 2.4, so for now we're including the latest here, just to make life a little easier for those not running Ansible from source. As indicated above, you will need to have Ansible 2.3 installed for this to work.

If your install of Ansible fails to find the common modules, then the easiest solution may be to run Ansible from source. If you need assistance, please view the [Running From Source guide](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html#running-from-source).
